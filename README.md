# HOMEWORK3
The third week step homework
The final evaluation function shuld obey the oder of first find the formula inside smallest pair brackets, then calculate this formula. When we do calculation, we shuld multiply/divid first and plus/minus later
I wrote multiply/divid function just like the function we wrote for plus and minus
For brackets function, I think I should find the samllest pair brackets first. I use an array to store all positions of left brackets, then use the last left bracket's position to match the first right bracket after it. This is the smallest pair bracket. Calculate the formula inside it use final evaluation function.
